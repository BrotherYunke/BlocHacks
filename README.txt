/////HOW TO USE/////
1. Download Ethereum Wallet
2. Rename Ethereum Wallet.exe to Ethereum_Wallet.exe (Or update the run_program.bat script)
3. Run Second_Life.exe, included in this repository to open the blockchain application

/////TOOLS/////
- Geolocation history data found in location_data.json, updated everytime Ethereum_Wallet.exe is opened thanks to the run_program.bat script.
- population_cluster.ipynb is a Jupyter Notebook that contains a K-means clustering algorithm and an example of its application when it comes to population analysis.

////POSSIBLE IMPROVEMENTS/////
- The implementation of the clustering method and the geolocation program inside the blockchain platform could provide valuable data to organisations whose goal is to provide aid relief to refugees around the world. An example would be providing supporting data when searching for missing persons, offering a way for families to reconnect if they are ver separated during their escape, optimizing the distribution of aid ressources to meet the needs of different groups of refugees, etc.
- The creation of a seperate blochain network given access only to refugees would allow a greater information access speed, as well as reduce initial synchronization time.
- Additional information can be stored within individual accounts, such as age, profession, income, etc., in order to provide more accurate data for researchers to analyze.
